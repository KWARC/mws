    - test more thoroughly src/socket/*  -- add MUTEXES
                                         -- fix accepting in constructor
                                         -- fix read / write (?)
    - check mem leaks in restd (minor)
    - tests for more components

WONTFIX:
    - memleak in xmlparser/write (when xmlOutputFlush fails) is singular and
    caused by the text buffer within __xmlRaiseError not being freed

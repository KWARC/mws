TODO:
    - fix init.d scripts slow stop
    - multiple arity tokens
    - test more thoroughly src/socket/*  -- add MUTEXES
                                         -- fix accepting in constructor
                                         -- fix read / write (?)
    - mainpage doxygen
    - document/unit test for most components
    - check mem leaks in restd (minor)
    - fix doxygen headers

FEATURES:
    - create mws schema with standard answers / error codes

WONTFIX:
    - memleak in xmlparser/write (when xmlOutputFlush fails) is singular and
    caused by the text buffer within __xmlRaiseError not being freed

    - Syscall param pwrite64(buf) points to uninitialised byte(s) warning
    from Bdb (on DB*->close()) is due to the fact that unitialized bytes are
    flushed to the file system. These are padding bytes which the database
    does not need. See the flag --enable-umrw from the BerekleyDB configuration
    manual for more explanations
